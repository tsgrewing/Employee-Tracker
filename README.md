  ## Development
  All the options given to the user are functional, but I plan on adding more options at a later date. One feature I am still working on is the option to view total payroll for any given department. 
  I also plan to refactor the code to be a little more DRY, and move the functions into smaller more digestible files to clean up the main app.js file. (For instance all the add functions would be in one file, and all the delete functions in another)
  
  ## Usage
  Clone the repo and then run app.js from the command line
